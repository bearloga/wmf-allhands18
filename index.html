<div id="section-types-of-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Types of variables</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"><em>Quantitative</em> variables</a> have a numeric value and/or an ordering
<ul>
<li><em>Continuous</em> variables have an infinite range of possible values
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: time, age, weight, lengths (height, distance, time spent online), drug dosage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quantitative variables that have limited possible values are <em>discrete</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: population size, number of times an event occurred, pageviews, number of questions a student got correct on a test</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Continuous variables are sometimes discretized by rounding if precision is not necessary</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable"><em>Categorical</em></a> / <em>discrete</em> / <em>qualitative</em> variables have a limited number of possible values:
<ul>
<li><em>Nominal</em> variables have two or more categories that do not have an intrinsic order
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: gender, ethnicity, controls vs test group, operating system</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Ordinal</em> variables are like nominal, but the categories have an ordering/ranking such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale">Likert rating scale</a></li>
<li>Categorical variables can also be created from quantitative variables
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: survey takers are often combined into age groups such as “18-24”</li>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart">pie chart</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_chart">bar chart</a> (sometimes called a <em>bar plot</em>) are an easy way to visually compare values. The pie chart – where the slices represent proportions of the whole – is excellent for 2-4 categories, the table is great for 1-8 categories, and the bars’ heights work well for comparing more than 5 categories.</p>

<p>In the past decade, a semi-alternative to the pie chart called <em>waffle charts</em> (or “square pie charts”) has gained popularity at representing relative sizes between groups. (See <a href="https://eagereyes.org/techniques/square-pie-charts">Women in IT – Squaring the Pie?</a>.) <strong>Semi-alternative</strong> becauses waffles compare <strong>totals</strong> and pie charts compare <strong>percentages</strong>. As such, waffle charts are good for comparing relative sizes, but not at comparing relative %s.</p>
<p>Each square represents a certain number of units, which I think makes it easier to visually compare sizes of groups. For example, it is easier to compare 11 squares (2nd class passengers who survived) to 20 squares (1st class passengers who survived) than 1 pie slice to another pie slice that is 1.8 times bigger:</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/waffle-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-histograms-and-densities" class="section level3">
<h3>Histograms and Densities</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram">histogram</a> shows the distribution of a continuous variable by splitting it into bins and counting how many observations fall into each bin (left). Sometimes those counts are divided by the total number of observations to yield proportions/probabilities instead (right). <strong>Note</strong> that the histogram on the right also includes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation">probability density estimate</a>.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/histograms-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>An important factor to watch out for is the bin size, which – ideally – was carefully chosen by the creator of the visualization. Bins that are too wide will cause the distribution to appear wide, while bins that are too narrow will make the distribution appear to noisy:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="index_files/figure-html4/bin_sizes-1.png" alt="The three little histo-bears." width="624" />

</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-comparing-distributions" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparing Distributions</h3>
<p>When you see one of these, they are used for comparing distributions of a continuous variable (such as sepal length of Iris flowers) between different groups (such as different species):</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/comparing_distributions-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation">density plot</a> on the left is like a smooth histogram that doesn’t discretize the variable into bins. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot">violin plot</a> on the right is a rotated version that makes it easier to perform the comparison because the densities (distributions) are not overlapping.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">box-and-whiskers chart</a> (also known as a <em>box plot</em>) allows you to visually compare the distributions by way of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary">five number summary</a> which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample minimum (the smallest value)</li>
<li>First <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile">quartile</a> (<em>Q<sub>1</sub></em>) which is the 25th percentile</li>
<li>Second quartile (<em>Q<sub>2</sub></em>) also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"><em>median</em></a></li>
<li>Third quartile (<em>Q<sub>3</sub></em>) which is the 75th percentile</li>
<li>Sample maximum (the largest value)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/boxplot-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>My personal preference is when a violin plot and a box plot are combined so you still see the distribution in case there are multiple peaks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)"><em>modes</em></a> – something you can’t see with just a box-and-whiskers plot – but you also see the summaries:</p>

<div id="section-multiple-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Multiple variables</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot">Scatter plots</a> are the most popular and simplest way to investigate relationships between quantitative variables. You have one variable on the X axis and one variable on the Y axis. Each point represents a single unit from your dataset (e.g. a subject of an experiment):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="index_files/figure-html4/scatterplot-1.png" alt="Shape and color of the points are determined by the species. Shapes are often used together with color to make the graphic better for colorblindness and grayscale printing." width="624" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Data scientists and analysts often use <em>scatterplot matrices</em> to look at many different relationships between pairs of variables simultaneously:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="index_files/figure-html4/scatterplot_matrices-1.png" alt="These are usually not present in final drafts of reports and are instead used as tools during the exploratory data analysis step." width="624" />
<p class="caption">
These are usually not present in final drafts of reports and are instead used as tools during the exploratory data analysis step.
</p>
</div>
<p>At first glance there is <strong>a lot</strong> going on in that particular matrix, but really there are three main components that we can focus on just one at a time:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the upper triangle panels have basic scatter plots with points colored according to species for each pair of variables,</li>
<li>the diagonal panels have histograms of the individual variables, and</li>
<li>the lower triangle panels are also scatterplots, but with ellipses tracing the two-dimensional densities (assuming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution">Normality</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart">Line charts</a> are the most common way to visualize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series">time series</a> data, with time <strong>usually</strong> as the horizontal X axis and range of a quantitative variable as the vertical Y axis:</p>
<div class="figure">

<h2>Other visualizations</h2>
<div id="section-mosaic-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Mosaic plots</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_plot">Mosaic plots</a> are used to visualize the relationships between two or more qualitative variables, and they are incredibly rare. While they are very useful once you learn how to read them, that step can be very difficult and so it is unsurprising that they don’t show up more. They’re often used by statisticians during exploratory data analysis to perform a visual check before performing a statistical test of independence.</p>
<p>We will use these to examine distribution of hair and eye colors in ~600 statistics students at University of Delaware reported by Snee, R. D. in <em>The American Statistician</em> journal in 1974:</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/mosaic1-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>We can extend a mosaic plot to include <em>standardized residuals</em> (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studentized_residual"><em>studendized residuals</em></a>) from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-linear_model">log-linear model</a>. Cells representing <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">negative residuals</span> – meaning there are <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">fewer observations than would have been expected under independence</span> – are drawn as <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">red</span> with broken borders; <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">positive residuals</span> – meaning <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">more observations than would be expected</span> – are drawn in <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> with solid borders.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/mosaic2-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>We can also look at the proportions across all three variables:</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/mosaic3-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>What the third mosaic plot tells us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blond was the most prevalent hair color among those with blue eyes.</li>
<li>More brown-haired men had blue eyes than brown-haired women.</li>
<li>More blond-haired women had blue eyes than blonde-haired men.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stacked area plots</h3>
<p>A <em>stacked area plot</em> is a way to visualize multiple amounts/proportions changes over time.</p>

<div id="section-heat-maps" class="section level3">
<h3>Heat maps</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map">Heatmaps</a> are a graphical representation of matrices. For example, we can visualize the following dataset of top 50 NBA players’ performance statistics from <a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_NBA_season)">the 2008-09 season</a> (obtained from <a href="https://www.rotowire.com/">RotoWire</a>, formerly databaseBasketball):</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/heatmap-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Howard">Dwight Howard</a> was the best at blocking shots</li>
<li>Dwight Howard was also one of the worst at making free throws</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Ming">Yao Ming</a> was the best at making three-pointers (by % successful out of total attempts)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/corr_map-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negative correlations</strong> (in <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#CA0020;">red</span>):
<ul>
<li>Players who made a higher percentage of field goals (“Fldgl.”) stayed away from trying to make three-point shots (“Thr-pa” is “Three-point attempts”).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Positive correlations</strong> (in <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#404040;">grey</span>):
<ul>
<li>Players who attempted/made more field goals (“Fldgla”/“Fldglm”) also scored more points.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-tree-maps" class="section level3">
<h3>Tree maps</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">Treemapping</a> is a way to visualize hierarchical (nested) data as rectangles within other rectangles, with the area of the rectangle representing the proportion and sometimes a shade or color representing another variable. It is not dissimilar to a mosaic plot!</p>
<div class="figure">

<div id="section-networks-and-graphs" class="section level3">
<h3>Networks and graphs</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing">Network diagrams</a> are for visualizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graphs</a> (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>) and networks (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory">network theory</a>) where there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science)"><em>nodes</em></a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)"><em>vertices</em></a>) connected by <em>links</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(graph_theory)"><em>edges</em></a>). Their goal is to visually represent relationships between units. For example, using <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_clickstream">the Wikipedia Clickstream data</a> from November 2017 we can start at the article on net neutrality and visualize a <em>neighborhood</em> of articles that are <em>adjacent</em> to the central one:</p>
<p><a title="By MPopov (WMF) (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ANet_neutrality_clickstream_(Nov_2017).png"><img width="512" alt="Net neutrality clickstream (Nov 2017)" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Net_neutrality_clickstream_%28Nov_2017%29.png/512px-Net_neutrality_clickstream_%28Nov_2017%29.png"/></a></p>
<p>The darkness of the edges connecting the vertices represents how many clicks there were between the pairs of articles. We can see that there are more clicks between “net neutrality” and “digital rights” than between “net neutrality” and “human rights”, but way more clicks between “net neutrality” and “Wikipedia Zero”.</p>
</div>

<div id="section-scales-and-transformed-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Scales and transformed data</h2>
<p>Sometimes the author of the visualization has chosen to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">transformation to the data</a> because the data is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness">skewed</a>. It is important to watch out for these, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale">logarithmic scales</a>.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html4/transformed_scatterplot-1.png" width="624" height="624" /></p>
